        longDescription: `Shapes HYROX insoles transform any shoe into an active companion, activating muscles from the foot to the jaw. Weighing just 30 grams and measuring only 2.7 millimeters thick, they are barely noticeable – yet they deliver a powerful effect. High-quality materials ensure maximum flexibility, while structured contact zones specifically stimulate the arch of the foot, improving stability, balance, and power transfer.
        Thanks to their rubberized surface, the insoles stay securely in place in your shoes, whether you're doing HYROX training , running, or going about your daily routine. Shapes restores the natural feel of running by simulating uneven surfaces like sand or grass – a feature often prevented by modern shoes and hard floors. The result is not only improved performance but also noticeable relief for your joints and support for recovery.
        Shapes HYROX insoles are suitable for athletes, leisure users, and anyone who wants to improve their stability and balance in everyday life. Simply insert them, start walking – and feel the difference.
        Go beyond faster – more speed through optimal power transmission 
        Go beyond better – improved stability, balance and regeneration  
        Go beyond stronger – Activation of the entire muscle chain from the feet to the jaw
